\usage{
choices_selected(
  choices,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{choices}{vector of possible choices or \code{delayed_data} object}

\item{selected}{vector of pre-selected options or \code{delayed_data} object.
If vector, then first element of \code{choices} if blank}

\item{keep_order}{(\code{logical}) In case of \code{FALSE} the selected variables
will be on top of the drop-down field.}

\item{fixed}{(\code{logical}) (optional) whether to block user to select choices}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{choices_selected} and of type list.
}

\details{
Please note that the order of selected will always follow the order of choices. The \code{keep_order}
argument is set to false which will run the following code inside:

\code{choices <- c(selected, setdiff(choices, selected))}

in case you want to keep your specific order of choices, set \code{keep_order} to \code{TRUE}.
